pip install pyautogui 
this helps to control the mouse pointer, keyboards keys, right click, left clicks, scroll etc

Object tracking
Used for vehicle navigation,surveillance system

HSV
Hue, Saturation, Value
Different from BGR format
Based on hsv value, we are going to identify the color and then track that color.

BGR to HSV 
From camera, we read the BGR image or frame
#dst = cv2.cvtColor(src,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

Minimum enclosing circle
we can able to get its parameter such as  x,y and radius.
#((x,y),radius) = cv2.minEnclosingCircle(countourArea)

Moments to fine center of the area
Moment: help you to calculate some features like center of mass of the object, area of the object etc.

#var = cv2.moments(contourArea)
center is Cx and Cy
center = (int(M["m10"]/M["m00"]),int(M["m01"]/M["m00"]))
Cx=m10/m00		Cy=m01/m00

Drawing circle
cv2.cirlce(src,(x,y),int(radius), color, thickness) 

To draw a dot, radius is static like 5
cv2.circle(frame, center, 5, (0,0,255), -1 )

Workflow of color object tracking
1. read frame from camera
2. pre-processing image (bgr to hsv, smoothening, dilation stc)
3. finding contours
4. draw minimum enclosing circle
5. finding center of contour area
6. draw circle and center
7. direction based on radius & position (used for tracking, left, right front or back)

Tuning color
red color hsv value low and high (google it)
